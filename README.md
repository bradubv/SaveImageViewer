You need to add the SmartDashboard.jar to the path
You can use the jar that gets installed by the wpilib Eclipse plugin.
On my computer that is at: `<drive>:\Users\<UserName>\wpilib\tools\SmartDashboard.jar`

Right click on the project and Export ... to Java -> JAR file to create
the Jar file that you need to save to:
`<drive>:\Users\<UserName>\SmartDashboard\extensions\SaveImageViewer.jar`

There is a file named `OutputJarSettings.jardesc` that shows you the settings
that can be used to export the project as a *.jar file.
